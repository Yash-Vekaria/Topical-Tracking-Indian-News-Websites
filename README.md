# Differential Tracking Across Topical Webpages of Indian News Media

This repository is to support the research community (for non-commercial purposes) to obtain topical subpages from the homepage of a website in a semi-automated manner and study tracking across these different topical subpages. The codes open-sourced here are related to our research paper titled _"Differential Tracking Across Topical Webpages of Indian News Media"_ and accepted to the _"13th ACM Web Science Conference 2021"_. However, these can be applied to other contexts and studies by minor modifications. 
Our DiBETS Methodology (Dictionary-Based Extraction of Topical Subpages), open source framework and dataset can promote further research and help policy makers or fellow researchers to supplement a deeper investigation of the understudied Indian news websites for a variety of different purposes. The codes and link to the tools used in our paper are listed below.

**Note: The labelled dataset of the Indian News Websites and crawls using these scripts can be requested from our dataset page [https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/netsys/datasets/india-topic/](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/netsys/datasets/india-topic/) (Please abide to our listed T&C).**
